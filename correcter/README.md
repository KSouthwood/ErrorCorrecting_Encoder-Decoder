Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About

Errors are inevitable both in life and in the digital world. Errors occur here and there and everywhere, and in this 
project you will not only imitate this process, but also learn how to cope with errors. It is a chance to experience 
what early developers had to cope with at the dawn of the computer era. Low-level programming is fun and insightful: 
try it and youâ€™ll see.

##### Stage 1

Write a program that creates errors in the input text, 1 random error per 3 characters.
i.e. "abc" can be "\*bc" or "a\*c" or "ab\*", where * is a random character.
