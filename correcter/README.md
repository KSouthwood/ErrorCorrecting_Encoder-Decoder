# Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder

Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About
Errors are inevitable both in life and in the digital world. Errors occur here and there and everywhere, and in this 
project you will not only imitate this process, but also learn how to cope with errors. It is a chance to experience 
what early developers had to cope with at the dawn of the computer era. Low-level programming is fun and insightful: 
try it and youâ€™ll see.

##### Stage 1
Write a program that creates errors in the input text, 1 random error per 3 characters.
i.e. "abc" can be "\*bc" or "a\*c" or "ab\*", where * is a random character.

##### Stage 2: Symbol-level correction code
Update program to now take the input text and encode the message by tripling all the symbols. Simulate transmission of
the text by introducing errors into it (as done in stage 1), and finally decoding the message. Output the result of each
step.

##### Stage 3: Bit-level error emulator
Write a program which will read from one file (`send.txt`) and write to another (`received.txt`) while changing one bit
in every byte. Introduces using Java Streams for more than reading/writing to the console. Also, makes use of bit-wise
operators to manipulate the data.

##### Stage 4: Bit-level correction code
Update the program, so it now takes input and implements three modes: encode, send, decode.

Encode reads in a file (`send.txt`) and encodes it by writing (to `encoded.txt`) each bit twice with the last two bits 
of each byte parity bits. (i.e. `10100110` becomes `11001100 00001111 11000011`).

Send uses what we wrote in the last stage to change one bit in each byte as it reads `encoded.txt` and writes to 
`received.txt`.

Decode reads from `received.txt` and decodes the file while fixing the errors and writes the result to `decoded.txt`.

##### Stage 5: Hamming error-correction code
Change the encoding/decoding algorithms to now use Hamming code[7, 4].
